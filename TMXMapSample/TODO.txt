- optimization!
	- tile objects beign drawn more efficiently?
	- blending mode on back-most layer?

- better accessors.
	- wrapper for getting GID for a layer based on coords rather than the layer info.
	- possible tile at coord given z depth?

- clean up naming?  Do we like JSTileMap and then TMX...obj naming convention?

- is our default position in the right place?  Is it centered or bottom-left?

- use new base64 functionality built into cocoa in iOS7
- can we use better zip support rather than using a 3rd party lib for this?

- ISO object positions and tile object positions are incorrect.

-ZOrdering isn't working properly?  Did apple flip this from furthest to nearest?

later:

- add code to make this work in macOS, should be pretty easy to do.
